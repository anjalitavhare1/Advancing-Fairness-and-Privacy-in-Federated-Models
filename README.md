# Advancing-Fairness-and-Privacy-in-Federated-Models
This project examines improving fairness and privacy in Federated Learning, a decentralized machine learning approach. It compares FedAvg and Q-FedAvg on the FEMNIST dataset, finding FedAvg superior in accuracy, speed, and fairness. However, analysis on the UCI Adult dataset uncovers potential biases.
